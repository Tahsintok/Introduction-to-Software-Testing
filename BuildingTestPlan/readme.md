## Building Test Plan

  In this assignment, I have developed a test plan for a software product called GolfScore. The Software Requirements Specification of GolfScore (SRS) has been provided, and it should have been taken into consideration while writing the test plan.

The test plan document includes the following sections: introduction, assumptions, test requirements and tools, resource requirements, test schedule, risks, and metrics. Additionally, the document also provides the test cases.
